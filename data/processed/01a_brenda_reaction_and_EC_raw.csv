The nucleophilic C-S  bond-formation step happens subsequently concomitant to relay of the  proton of the iron(II)-hydroperoxo back to Tyr377. This is the  rate-determining step in the reaction cycle and is followed by  hydrogen-atom transfer from the CE1-H group of trimethyl histidine  substrate to iron(II)-superoxo. In the final step, a quick and almost  barrierless sulfoxidation leads to the sulfoxide product complexes.  Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics study of the mechanism of  sulfoxide synthase enzymes as compared to cysteine dioxygenase enzymes  and present pathways for both reaction channels in EgtB, reaction  mechanism, overview. The active site contains the unusual Tyr157-Cys93  cross-link with a covalent bond between the two amino acid residues. It  is believed this cross-link has a steric effect on the overall reaction  mechanism. The fast CDO-type side reaction is prevented through a  proton-coupled electron transfer from Tyr377 to iron(III)-superoxo,  which enables the slower C-S bond formation to take place and blocks  the sulfur dioxygenation side reaction <5>; #5# two different  mechanisms are analyzed, depending on whether the sulfoxidation or the  S-C bond formation takes place first. The calculations suggest that the  S-O bond formation occurs first between the thiolate and the ferric  superoxide, followed by homolytic O-O bond cleavage. Subsequently,  proton transfer from a second-shell residue Tyr377 to the newly  generated iron-oxo moiety takes place, which is followed by proton  transfer from the N-alpha-trimethyl histidine imidazole to Tyr377,  facilitated by two crystallographically observed water molecules. Next,  the S-C bond is formed between gamma-glutamyl cysteine and  N-alpha-trimethyl histidine, followed by proton transfer from the  imidazole CH moiety to Tyr377, which is calculated to be the  rate-limiting step for the whole reaction, with a barrier of 17.9  kcal/mol in the quintet state.

This step, which  is also rate-limiting, yields the first CO2 molecule and the reactive  intermediate in which the formyl radical anion coordinates the  high-spin Mn(3). The quartet to sextet spin transition, which involves  a small apparent barrier, allows for the formyl radical -> Mn(3)  electron transfer.

CH5 and the combined  CH10 and CH11 are not connected with the cavity. No permeation of water  molecules between the channels is found except in the combined  channels. The results of the present analysis are consistent with the  selective transport hypothesis <56>; #6# the simulation method of  Markovian milestoning molecular dynamics simulations is used to compute  the entry and exit kinetics of O2 in the enzyme. The rate of flavin  oxidation by O2 is likely not strongly limited by diffusion from the  solvent to the active site. The predicted faster entry and slower exit  of O2 for the bound state indicate a longer residence time within the  enzyme, increasing the likelihood of collisions with the flavin  isoalloxazine ring, a step required for reduction of molecular O2 and  subsequent reoxidation of the flavin <61>)  "

A further two-electron reduction leads to the S0  state, weakening the remaining S-O bond. With the final transfer of two  electrons, the state of sulfide (S2II) is reached and a third water is  released, catalytic mechanism overview. The heterobimetallic  active-site heme 2 has a Cu(I) ion juxtaposed to a heme c at a Fe-Cu  distance of 4.4 A. While the combination of metals is reminiscent of  respiratory heme-copper oxidases, the oxidation-labile Cu(I) centre of  MccA does not seem to undergo a redox transition during catalysis.  Intact MccA tightly binds SO2 at heme 2, a dehydration product of the  substrate sulfite that is partially turned over due to photoreduction  by X-ray irradiation, yielding the reaction intermediate SO. Structure  of sulfite reduction at heme2 of MccA, sulfite binds to the resting  state of the enzyme, but the active-site architecture shifts the  reversible dehydration equilibrium to SO2 + H2O. Reduction by two  electrons occurs through photoreduction in the X-ray beam and leads to  release of a second H2O after protonation, with SO remaining bound to  the active site. A tight network of hydrogen bonds surrounds the  bimetal centre and the bound substrate, holding the reaction products  in place. The sulfite substrate only oxidizes half the heme groups of  reduced MccA, emphasizing that the total electron charge of the  multiheme enzyme is of high relevance for catalysis <25>) "

The nucleophilic cysteine attacks the beta-carbon of  the 3-ketoacyl-CoA and becomes covalently modified. Another cysteine,  Cys382, acts first as an acid providing a proton for the leaving  acetyl-CoA and next as a base abstracting a proton from the incoming  CoA. The activated CoA molecule then attacks the carbonyl C atom of the  acylated cysteine and the fatty acyl-CoA is released. The cysteine  acting as the nucleophile is activated by a conserved histidine residue  (His352).

Deprotonation of phosphate by Arg104, increases the negative charge on  the phosphate oxygen, leading to repulsion between the electrons of  phosphate oxygen and electron pairs of the endocylic ribosyl oxygen and  the formation of an intermediate oxocarbenium ion. At the same time,  the Gln206, Arg208 and Arg264-N1 hydrogen network-bond pulls electrons  from the glycosidic bond onto the pyrimidine ring. These two actions  work in concert to weaken the glycosidic bond. Arg39 pivots, to  physically push the phosphate closer to the ribose moiety. After  glycosidic bond cleavage, ribose-1-phosphate dissociates from the  active pocket, and then an active water reprotonates the negatively  charged purine.

The nascent methyl  radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the CoB thiol, generating  methane and a CoB thiyl radical (step 2). The CoB thiyl radical attacks  the sulfur of the F430-Ni(II)-thiolate(CoM) intermediate, affording an  F430-Ni(I) species and releasing a CoB/CoM heterodisulfide  (CoB-S-S-CoM) (step 3). The addition of CoB and methyl-CoM to this form  of the enzyme allows for another round of turnover (step 4). It is  likely that the same mechanism proposed for MCR can be used for ethane  and even additional short-chain alkanes such as propane and butane.

Nucleophilic attack by an active  site aspartate side chain in the third step leads to a covalent  intermediate that is further hydrolysed into the two product molecules  (step 4). Finally, the enzyme is required to remove the cap from the  core domain in a conformational change (step 5). It can reasonably be  assumed that the steps involving domain movements (steps 2 and 5)  proceed much slower than the chemistry steps (3 and 4). These multiple  processes occur in a population of enzyme molecules in a  non-synchronised fashion. Additionally, it is possible that individual  enzyme molecules undergo a conformational change between open and  closed states in the absence of substrate molecules. Such  non-synchronised conformational changes will lead to a decrease in the  overall rate of the enzymatic reaction of a population of molecules  <69>; #37# molecular mechanism, overview. The catalytic mechanism  involves a nucleophilic attack by an aspartate in the active site  targeting the phosphorus of the phosphate group, which undergoes a  conformational change via a trigonal bipyramidal transition state. The  release of trehalose renders an enzyme-phosphate conjugate that is  hydrolyzed in a second step. It is generally believed that a water  molecule is activated by a second aspartate to form a hydroxyl ion that  performs a nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus, thus hydrolyzing the  aspartate-phosphoester and release of the phosphate. In contrast to  Asp213, the residue inferred to carry out the nucleophilic attack on  the substrate, Asp215 and Asp428 of enzyme BmTPP are involved in the  chemistry steps of enzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate <62>)  "

The reaction is supposed to proceed by a two-step  addition-elimination (An + Dn) mechanism, which goes through a common  pentavalent intermediate observed in phosphoryl transfer reactions. The  first step is the activation of H2O by Asp269 and Glu53 to form a  nucleophile hydroxide and a metastable pentavalent complex.

The  phosphoryl oxygen and one of the ester oxygens bind in a bidentate  manner to the beta-metal allowing polarization of the phosphorus  center. The bridging hydroxide attacks the phosphorus center forming a  phosphorane-like transition state with delocalization of charge  supported by coordination to the metal as well as the electronegative  ester groups. Once the phosphorane species is formed, the pKa of the  attacking OH group will be drastically reduced and the proton can be  passed to Glu407. In the substrate-docked structure of Sb-PTE, the free  oxygen of Glu407 is 4.0 A from the leaving group oxygen, which would  enable transfer of the proton to the leaving group, facilitating the  collapse of the phosphorane intermediate into products <218>; #57#  reaction mechanism of lactonase activity and paraoxonase activity of  the enzyme PON1, overview <237>)  "

Proposed  mechanism for phosphoenzyme intermediate formation involving Asp229 as  the nucleophile. (i) Asp229 attacks the phosphorus center of DFP to  form a pentavalent intermediate and (ii) the P-F bond dissociates to  form a tetrahedral phosphoenzyme intermediate. Hydrolysis of the  phosphoenzyme intermediate is not shown. And proposed mechanism for  hydrolysis involving an activated water as the nucleophile. (i) Asp229  abstracts a proton from a water molecule either stepwise or in concert  as (ii) water attacks the phosphorus center, (iii) Glu21 abstracts a  proton either stepwise or in concert as water forms a bond with  phosphorus, and (iv) the P-F bond dissociates <46>; #27# catalytic  reaction mechanism involving residue Asp269, molecular dynamics and  modelling, overview <47>; #28# molecular details of the catalytic  mechanism of h-PON1 <44>; #27# the catalytic mechanism of DFPase is  investigated using the hybrid density functional theory method B3LYP  with a large quantum chemical model of the active site abstracted from  the X-ray crystal structure. For the first step, two different pathways  are considered: (1) residue Asp229 as a nucleophile inline attacks on  the phosphorus center and (2) an activated water molecule as the  nucleophile attacks on the phosphorus center. Both the Asp229 and the  activated water molecule are capable of proceeding nucleophilic attack  on the substrate in the presence of Ca2+ ion with the associated  barriers 14.8 and 6.0 kcal/mol, respectively. The latter is much easier  to perform the nucleophile attack. From the phosphoenzyme intermediate  with the hexa-coordinated Ca2+, the uncoordinated Glu21 functions as a  general base activated an additional water molecule to attack the  carbon center of Asp229 and make the phosphate release. Residues Asn120  and Asn175 promote the elimination of the fluoride via donating strong  hydrogen bonds. Residue Asp229 plays a dual role during the hydrolysis  reaction process, either as a nucleophile or as a general base to  activate the water nucleophile. The role of the calcium ion is  providing a necessary conformation of the active site, facilitating the  nucleophile formation and substrate orientation <50,51>)  "

Coordination of one of  the hydroxyl groups of the gem-diol to a Ca2+ ion facilitates the  development of a negative charge on the O atom as its proton is lost to  a base. The negatively charged O atom nucleophilically attacks the  sulfur centre of the N-linked sulfate group on the glucosamine  substrate (step 2), resulting in a covalently bound enzyme-substrate  complex with a pentavalent sulfur transition state. An acid (possibly  His181) facilitates the cleavage of the S-N bond by protonating the  bridging N atom to form an amine leaving group on the N-desulfated  substrate, which diffuses away, leaving an O-sulfated enzyme (step 3).  Finally, in a step that underlines the importance of the formylglycine  residue, another base (His125) deprotonates the second hydroxyl group,  resulting in a negatively charged O atom (step 4) that forms a double  bond with the C atom as the C-O bond between it and the bridging O  atom of the sulfate group breaks, eliminating the sulfate ion and  regenerating the formylglycine residue (step 5) <29>)  "

In the  initial light-independent step, a 6-iminium ion is thought to be  generated via proton transfer induced by two histidines highly  conserved among the (6-4) photolyases.This intermediate spontaneously  rearranges to form an oxetane intermediate by intramolecular  nucleophilic attack. In the subsequent light-driven reaction, one  electron is believed to be transferred from the fully reduced FAD  cofactor (FADH-) to the oxetane intermediate thus forming a neutral  FADH radical and an anionic oxetane radical, which spontaneously  fractures. The excess electron is then back-transferred to the flavin  radical restoring the fully reduced flavin cofactor and a pair of  pyrimidine bases <5,6,7,8,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20>; #4# Fourier  transform infrared spectroscopy is applied to (6-4)DNA photolyase.  Differences in FTIR spectra that correspond to (6-4)DNA photolyase  photoactivation, substrate binding, and light-dependent DNA repair  processes are reported. The presence of DNA carrying a single (6-4) PP  uniquely influences vibrations of the protein backbone and a protonated  carboxylic acid, whereas photoactivation produces IR spectral changes  for the FAD cofactor and the surrounding protein. Difference FTIR  spectra for the light-dependent DNA damage repair reaction directly  show significant DNA structural changes in the (6-4) lesion and the  neighboring phosphate group.

By femtosecond synchronization of the enzymatic dynamics  with the repair function, direct electron transfer from the excited  flavin cofactor to the 6-4 photoproduct is observed in 225 ps but fast  back electron transfer in 50 ps without repair. The catalytic proton  transfer between a histidine residue in the active site and the 6-4  photoproduct, induced by the initial photoinduced electron transfer  from the excited flavin cofactor to 6-4 photoproduct, occurs in 425 ps  and leads to 6-4 photoproduct repair in tens of nanoseconds <34>; #1#  using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics studies, a repair mechanism  is proposed, which involves two photoexcitations. The flavin  chromophore, initially being in its reduced anionic form, is  photoexcited and donates an electron to the (6-4) form of the  photolesion. The photolesion is then protonated by the neighboring  histidine residue and forms a radical intermediate. A second  photoexcitation of the flavin promotes another electron transfer to the  oxetane.

Residues Trp342 and Trp390 are  essential for charge transfer, Trp342 is located at the periphery of  PhrB, while Trp390 connects Trp342 and Tyr391. Charge transfer occurs  via the triad 391-390-342. Charge transfer simulations reveal an  unusual stabilization of the positive charge on site 391 compared to  other photolyases or cryptochromes. Water molecules near Tyr391 offer a  polar environment which stabilizes the positive charge on this site,  thereby lowering the energetic barrier intrinsic to tyrosine. This  opens a second charge transfer channel in addition to tunnelling  through the tyrosine barrier, based on hopping and therefore transient  oxidation of Tyr391, which enables a fast charge transfer similar to  proteins utilizing a tryptophan-triad <42>; #13# reaction mechanism of  repair of (6-4) lesions by (6-4) photolyase, detailed overview.

At the 1+ oxidation state, the [4Fe-4S]  cluster provides an electron to the S-adenosyl-L-methionine, which  binds to the cluster in a bidentate manner as the fourth and fifth  ligands, to reductively cleave the C-S bond associated with the  sulfonium ion in S-adenosyl-L-methionine, generating a reactive  5-deoxyadenosyl radical. This 5-dA radical abstracts the proR hydrogen  atom from the C6 carbon of spore photoproduct to initiate the repair  process. The resulting spore photoproduct radical subsequently  fragments to generate a putative thymine methyl radical, which accepts  a back-donated H atom to yield the repaired  thymidylyl-(3->5)-thymidylate.

A conserved cysteine donates an H atom to the thymine radical,  resulting in a putative thiyl radical. Two conserved tyrosines are also  critical in enzyme catalysis. One, Y99, is downstream of the cysteine,  suggesting that the enzyme uses a hydrogen atom transfer pathway with a  pair of cysteine-tyrosine residues to regenerate  S-adenosyl-L-methionine. The other tyrosine, Y97, has a structural role  to facilitate S-adenosyl-L-methionine binding.

Then, following  the elimination of glucose, the acyl-enzyme complex is formed, and an  intramolecular nucleophilic attack by a terminal hydroxyl group of  6-Pos, but not by water, occurs. This nucleophilic attack results in  the formation of the five-membered ring structure of Pa. If the  acylenzyme complex is subjected to a nucleophilic attack by activated  water, then ?-hydroxy acids are released as hydrolytic products, but  this process never occurs in the TCE reactions <3>)  "

The mutagenic replacement of  Phe120 causes a positional change in His119 and that is a major cause  in decreasing the activity of the enzyme. Phe120 is important in fixing  the proper spatial position of His119 near the C-terminal region for  efficient activity. Phe120 interacts not directly with His119, but with  the hydrophobic core <63>; #3# protein of 128 amino acid residues,  catalyses the cleavage of RNA specifically on the 3-side of pyrimidine  bases.

The sulfate anion is progressively released  with pH and water molecules occupy the active site at pH 7.1. The  enzyme adopts different conformational states in different pH  conditions.

Thr45 of the B1 subsite contributes  to the enzyme substrate specificity and plays an important role in  catalysis. Phe120 in the B1 subsite enhances substrate binding with the  aid of its pi electron and hydrophobicity. Asn71 in the B2 subsite is  responsible for productive interactions leading to efficient activity,  and Glu111 in the same subsite contributes to substrate binding only in  the binding of guanosine. Lys7, Arg10 and Gln11 in the P2 subsite also  play an important role in catalysis. Some amino acid residues are  located in the vicinity of the catalytic residues and contribute to the  catalytic reaction by interacting with catalytic residues. Lys7, Arg10  and Lys66 maintain the optimum pKa of His12 and His119. Asp121  positions the proper tautomer of His119. Phe120 is responsible for the  strict positioning of His119, and contributes to conformational  stability. Tyr97 is involved in maintaining the correct position of  Lys41.

If the starting substrate is D-serine, S84 is  likely to be protonated, favoring the extraction of hydrogen from the  Calpha atom of pyridoxal 5-phosphate-D-serine. The resulting planar  intermediate allows K56 amino group to provide a proton from the  si-face, restoring the L-serine intermediate. As a result, K56 reacts  with pyridoxal 5-phosphate to form the Schiff base and releases the  L-serine as the final product. Catalytic mechanism, overview <70>; #5#  the abstraction and addition of alpha-hydrogen to L- and D-serine are  conducted by residues K56 and S81 at the si- and re-sides,  respectively, of pyridoxal 5-phosphate, K56 functions as a residue that  abstracts the alpha-hydrogen from the Schiff base intermediate,  two-base catalytic mechanism, overview <61>; #6# two-base racemization  mechanism, overview. The enzyme utilizes a two-base mechanism wherein  one enantiospecific Broensted base abstracts the proton from the  L-Ser-pyridoxal 5-phosphate aldimine and the conjugate acid of a second  enantiospecific Bronsted base protonates the intermediate to form the  D-Ser-pyridoxal 5-phosphate aldimine, and vice versa <62>; #14,17#  analysis of the catalytic reaction mechanism and intermediate  stabilization in mammalian serine racemase using multiscale  quantum-classical simulations, hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular  mechanics molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with umbrella  sampling are performed, overview. The unprotonated pyridoxal  5-phosphate-substrate intermediate is stabilized mostly due to  solvation effects contributed by water molecules and active-site  residues, as well as long-range electrostatic interactions with the  enzyme environment <74>; #13,14# reaction mechanism, the enzyme  catalyzes the racemization of serine, but also the  alpha,beta-elimination of serine forming pyruvate. Mechanicistically,  the racemization and alpha,beta-elimination reactions share the same  intermediate, represented by a resonance-stabilized carbanion. The  intermediate forms a partition between the two pathways. L-Serine binds  to pyridoxal 5-phosphate, yielding an external aldimine intermediate,  followed by the abstraction of the alpha-proton by Lys56 and formation  of a planar resonance-stabilized carbanion. At this point, protonation  in the opposite side of the carbanion intermediate (mediated by the  Ser84-OH group) generates D-serine. Since the proton abstraction and  the reprotonation steps are performed by different residues (Lys56 and  Ser84) that work as acid/base catalysts, serine racemase racemization  is consistent with a two-base mechanism <80>; #22# reversible  racemization and irreversible dehydration reactions are catalyzed by  eukaryotic serine racemase, overview <71>; #13# SRR catalyses Ser  racemization via a two-base mechanism in which two catalytic residues,  Lys56 and Ser84 play vital roles in the abstraction and donation of  alpha-proton of L-Ser and D-Ser, respectively <82>)  "

The  carbamate intermediate, formed by the reaction of ammonia with carboxy  phosphate, is subsequently channeled 45 A to the active site, located  at the C-terminus of the large subunit, for the synthesis of carbamoyl  phosphate, which is phosphorylated by the second molecule of MgATP to  form the ultimate product carbamoyl phosphate.

The two  narrow parts render two free energy barriers of 6.7 and 8.4 kcal/mol,  respectively. Three water pockets are filled with about 21, 9, and 9  waters, respectively, and the corresponding relative free energies of  carbamate residing in these free energy minima are 5.8, 0, and 1.6  kcal/mol, respectively. The release of phosphate into solution at the  site for the formation of carbamate allows the side chain of R306 to  rotate toward E25, E383, and E604. This rotation is virtually  prohibited by a barrier of at least 23 kcal/mol when phosphate remains  bound. This conformational change not only opens the entrance of the  tunnel but also shields the charge-charge repulsion from the three  glutamate residues when carbamate passes through the tunnel <92>) "
