# ERxn

The enzyme reaction dataset is desgined for 
machine learning applications using enzymes
based on the [ENZYME](https://enzyme.expasy.org/) 
repository of information relative to the 
nomenclature of enzymes. It is 
primarily based on the recommendations of the 
Nomenclature Committee of the International 
Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology 
(IUBMB) and it describes each type of 
characterized enzyme for which an EC (Enzyme 
Commission) number has been provided 
[[More details](https://enzyme.expasy.org/enzyme_details.html) 
/ [References](https://enzyme.expasy.org/enzyme_ref.html)].

The ERxn dataset contains all enzymes which
have available fasta sequences and their 
corresponding EC numbers, reactions in
form of smiles and co-factors
